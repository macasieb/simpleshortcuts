SimpleShortcuts
===============

Makes accesing your favourite programs easier. Useful with assigning it to a keyboard shortcut/mouse gesture.

On application, you can run applications with Alt+[Letter] without mouse interaction. On my typical usage, I assign Alt+Q to open simpleshortcuts and then press corresponding shortcut without releasing alt key.
